## Installation

This plug-in required `isort`.

`pip install isort`

`plug 'fisadev/vim-isort'`

**Vim**

Add the following in your `~/.vimrac` in the plug-in section

| :IYMD [#] year/month/day<br>:IMDY [#] month/day/year<br>:IDMY [#] day/month/year| Will use the starting line's date to construct an increasing or decreasing list of dates, depending on the sign of the number. Default increment: 1 (in days)
| :ID [#] | Will produce an increasing/decreasing list of daynames.  Three-letter daynames will be used if the first day on the first line is a three letter dayname; otherwise, full names will be used.|
|:IO [#]<br>:IIO [#] [zfill] | Like :I and :II, except visincr creates octal numbers.|
|:IR [#]<br>:IIR [#] [zfill]| Like :I and :II, except visincr uses Roman numerals.  Negative and zero counts are not supported for Roman numerals.|
|:IX [#]<br>:IIX [#] [zfill]| Like :I and :II, except visincr creates hexadecimal numbers.|

###    EXTRA NOTES
- For `:I :II :IO :IIO :IR :IIR` :

If the visual block is ragged on the right-hand side (as can
easily happen when the "$" is used to select the
right-hand-side), the block will have spaces appended to
straighten it out.  If the string length of the count exceeds
the visual-block, then additional spaces will be inserted as
needed.  Leading tabs are handled by using virtual column
calculations.

- For `:IR and :IIR` :

Since Roman numerals vary considerably in their lengths for
nearby numbers, an additional two spaces will be included.

- For `:IYMD, :IMDY, and IDMY` :

You'll need the <calutil.vim> plugin, available as
"Calendar Utilities" under the following url:

http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#CALUTIL

- Help is included, too -- check out  :he visincr-examples to see
even more examples of each command in action.
